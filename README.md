This project is dedicated to the module ITPM @SLIIT Y3 S1

Project Description - 
Brief description of the project	This whole project is regarding an Airline Seating Reservation System that can be used to manage the peoples who are expecting a fast and convenient way for booking their flight tickets without any delay. Using this system, users can book their flight ticket as their preference and also, they are able to pay the calculated amount using the integrated payment system without any faults.
Users can add several payment methods so that they can use preferred payment method for different payments throughout the system. Also, users can view their recently added bookings, make changes or delete. From the system administration panel aspect, admin can login to the system using special authorization and be able to schedule flights, make changes for special bookings and so on. As a team our main goal is to build this system accurately in every possible way.
